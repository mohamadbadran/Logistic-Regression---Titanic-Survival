# Logistic-Regression---Titanic-Survival
We're going to train a logistic regression classifier to classify titanic data set, we're going to predict whether somebody would have survived the titanic or not based on their features like age,class,sex....

#PROBLEM STATEMENT

The sinking of the Titanic on April 15th, 1912 is one of the most tragic tragedies in history. The Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers. The numbers of survivors were low due to the lack of lifeboats for all passengers and crew. Some passengers were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and upper-class. This case study analyzes what sorts of people were likely to survive this tragedy. The dataset includes the following:

.Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

.Sex: Male or Female

.Age: Age in years

.Sibsp: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic

.Parch: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic

.Ticket: Ticket number

.Fare: Passenger fare

.Cabin: Cabin number

.Embarked: Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

.Target class: Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

The dataset includes some data that do not affect our predictions like PassengerID... so we will omit these data to make a better model.
